I'm currently a Research Assistant Professor at the Vision and System Design Lab ([VSDL](https://vsdl.hkust.edu.hk/)) of HKUST. 
I also collaborate closely with InnoHK AI Chip Center for Smart Emerging Systems ([ACCESS](https://inno-access.hk/faculties)).
My research focuses on efficient computer architecture for algorithms in machine learning including:
- Solvers for convex optimization problems
- Neural network training on the edge
- Neural network inference in imaging flow cytometry

Openings
=====
We have exciting opportunities for [Research Assistants](https://inno-access.hk/research-assistant-rth) and [Post-docs](https://inno-access.hk/post-doctoral-fellow) in ACCESS. 
These positions are under the [RTH-ITF](https://www.itf.gov.hk/en/funding-programmes/nurturing-talent/research-talent-hub/research-talent-hub-for-itf-projects-rth-itf-/index.html) Scheme and have competitive salaries and fringe benefits.

We are specifically looking for individuals with expertise in **convex optimization** algorithms and tools like [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org). 
If you are interested, please apply through the provided links or reach out to me directly.
