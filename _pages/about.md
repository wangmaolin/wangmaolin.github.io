I'm currently a post-doc researcher on computer architecture. 
My research interest is in the design methodology of application-specific accelerators.
I've designed acceleration architectures in many domains, including:
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier for single-cell analysis in ultrafast imaging flow cytometry
- CNN training with only integer data types
- Solvers for convex quadratic programming
